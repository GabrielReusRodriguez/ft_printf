width:
    If the converted value has
       fewer  characters  than the field width, it will be padded with spaces on the left (or right, if the left‚Äêadjustment flag
       has been given).

Precision:
    If the precision is given as just '.', the
       precision is taken to be zero.  A negative precision is taken as if the precision were omitted.  This gives  the  minimum
       number of digits to appear for d, i, o, u, x, and X conversions, the number of digits to appear after the radix character
       for  a,  A,  e, E, f, and F conversions, the maximum number of significant digits for g and G conversions, or the maximum
       number of characters to be printed from a string for s and S conversions.
